The Simple Python Certificate Generator its generates certificate based on the given name list automatically.
This script uses Python & OpenCV.
The Simple Python Certificate Generator script leverages Python and OpenCV to automate the creation of certificates. Hereâ€™s a brief overview of how it works:

Template Loading: The script starts by loading a certificate template image.
Reading Names: It reads a list of names from an Excel file or a text file.
Text Placement: Using OpenCV, it calculates the appropriate position on the template to place each name.
Certificate Generation: The script then writes each name onto the template and saves the generated certificates as image files.
This automation can save a lot of time, especially when dealing with large numbers of certificates
